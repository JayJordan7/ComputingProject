This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
"Once we get the I2C tools installed, we need to make sure we can detect the ADC. We need to scan the I2C bus using
i2cdetect - r 1 

in the command center, which will scan the port and tell us exactly what we
 have there and some things we may be able to do with it.
 When we have confirmed that the Raspberry Pi has detected the ADC, we can begin with
our program that will actually chart it’s input. Python will be the code language used to do this.
We will import a package found online that was initially used to chart humidity and temperature
through the I2C port. I’ve taken the code from this project and made proper changes to change
the detection to incoming readings from our ADC.
After installing the necessary files, in Python script, run"

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
